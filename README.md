The code you provided is a simple Node.js script that creates an HTTP server using the http module and responds with a basic HTML message when accessed. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Here's a breakdown of the code:
// Make the server listen on port 8080

i. Import the http module:

var http = require('http');
This line imports the built-in http module in Node.js, which provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.

ii. Define a request handling function:

var handleRequest = function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end("<h1>I welcome You all to Cloud Scripting Using Google App Engine(PaaS) Standard</h1>");
}
Here, handleRequest is a function that will be invoked whenever an HTTP request is received. It sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK) and sends an HTML response to the client.

iii. Create an HTTP server:

var www = http.createServer(handleRequest);
This line creates an HTTP server using the createServer method from the http module. It takes the handleRequest function as an argument, meaning that this function will handle incoming requests.

iv. Make the server listen on port 8080:

www.listen(8080);
This line makes the server listen on port 8080 for incoming HTTP requests.

When you run this script, it starts an HTTP server that listens on port 8080. When you access http://localhost:8080 in a web browser, the server responds with the specified HTML message.
